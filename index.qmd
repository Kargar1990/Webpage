## About Me

I am a **Mechanical Engineering PhD candidate** with a specialization in **HVAC systems** and a keen focus on **optimizing thermal management solutions for data centers**. My expertise encompasses advanced CFD, proposal writing, and robust data analytics, skills that I've developed through practical leadership roles in project management and collaborative projects.

With a proficiency in both technical analyses and teamwork, I bridge the gap between theoretical research and real-world applications, leveraging tools like **Autodesk CFD, SolidWorks, and programming languages Python & R** to enhance system performance. I thrive in fast-paced environments, delivering diagnostic expertise and strategic visions that contribute to the advancements in data center cooling technologies.

## Education

-   **Doctor of Philosophy, Mechanical Engineering**, George Mason University, USA (Aug. 2021 --- Ongoing)

    -   Received the prestigious Presidential Scholarship, fully supporting four years of my Ph.D. program.

-   **Master of Science, Data Analytics**, George Mason University, USA (Aug. 2023 --- Ongoing)

-   **Master of Science, Mechanical Engineering**, Sharif University of Technology, Iran (Sep. 2013 --- Sep. 2015)

-   **Bachelor of Science, Mechanical Engineering**, Tafresh University, Iran (Sep. 2009 --- Sep. 2013)
